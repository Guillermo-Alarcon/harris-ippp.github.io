<p>The past five to ten years have witnessed an explosion in both the collection of ‘big data,’ and the sophistication and accessibility of the tools required to analyze that data. This has spurred government agencies and policy analysts to develop novel, data-driven approaches to policy creation and evaluation.</p>

<p>This is an introductory course in programming and data analysis for public policy students with no prior coding experience. It is for anyone who wants to gather, explore, and share quantitative data – or work with others who do. The course has three goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Early on, students will learn to think algorithmically using self-contained problems in python.</li>
<li>We will then cover tools and recipes for retrieving, cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data. This will include:

<ul>
<li>The command line. It is the ‘standard’ interface to computers for programmers. We’ll cover how to navigate it and use its many tools.</li>
<li>Coding in python: fundamentals of the language including types, control, functions and classes, input/output, complexity theory, debugging. Students will learn to turn a question into a python program.</li>
<li>Fundamentals of data science libraries (toolkits) including pandas and geopandas, plotting with matplotlib and seaborn, and basic analysis with scikit-learn.</li>
<li>Basics of relational databases – one of the most powerful ways of storing, accumulating, combining, and accessing data.</li>
<li>Basic web development: simple websites and an introduction to dynamic sites.</li>
<li>Creating datasets and accessing available data: scraping web data and using APIs.</li>
<li>Geographic Information Systems (GIS): representing your data in beautiful maps.</li>
<li>Large projects depend on many people working together on the same code. Version control (now git) makes this possible. Students will use it to submit all work, and to collaborate on several assignments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately, students should be comfortable applying skills for research at Harris and beyond, and confident independently exploring new packages for further projects. They should know enough to work with and direct engineers for the projects that they need, and they should understand the potential of such work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout we’ll emphasize good practices for collaborative code development and strive to de- mystify computers, the internet, and open source software. Particularly after the first weeks, we’ll highlight how these skills apply to evaluating and improving policy.</p>
